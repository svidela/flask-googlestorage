About
=====

This project started as a fork of `Flask-Uploads <https://github.com/maxcountryman/flask-uploads>`_. In fact, the way in which buckets are defined and how files are saved locally before uploading them to Google Cloud was mainly inspired by the class ``UploadSet`` in Flask-Uploads. Although is not its main focus, this extension could be used for local storage and serve uploaded files with Flask similarly to what Flask-Uploads does. However, it worth noting that such a feature is provided mainly to support files uploads/downloads without using Google Cloud Storage during development.
